## Project Name
Interactive Inventory Management Program 

## Project Description 
This project is a Python-based inventory management program for a shoe retailer built with object-oriented programming that:

* Reads in data from a file called `inventory.txt`.
* Establishes a `Shoe` class to store shoe details.
* Defines `methods` in the `Shoe` class to return the following individual shoe information:
  * Cost
  * Quantity
  * Formatted details
* Creates `functions` outside the `Shoe` class to handle the following inventory-wide operations:
  * View all
  * Search
  * Restock
  * Find sale item
  * Find total value
* Provides an interactive menu for inventory navigation, actions, and exit.
